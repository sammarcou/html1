                take my hand through the flames
                (I torture you) I'm a slave to your games
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down (ooh-ooh)
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                I'm a sucker for pain
                I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles (my ankles)
                Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion (yeah)
                We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure (oh, yeah)
                Do it for the fam, dawg, ten toes down, dawg
                Love and the loyalty, that's what we stand for (uh-huh)
                Alienated by society
                All this pressure give me anxiety (anxiety, anxiety)
                Walk slow through the fire
                Like, who gon' try us?
                Feeling the world go against us ('gainst us)
                So we put the world on our shoulders
                take my hand through the flames
                (I torture you) I'm a slave to your games
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down (ooh-ooh)
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
                I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
                I been ridin' 'round the city with my squad
                I been ridin' 'round the city with my squad
                We just posted, gettin' crazy, livin' like this is so amazing
                Hold up, take a step back when we roll up 'cause I know what
                We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
                Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
                I know, I been bustin', no discussion for my family
                No hesitation, through my scope, I see my enemy
                Like, what's up? Hol' up, we finna re-load up
                Yes, I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up
                take my hand through the flames
                (I torture you) I'm a slave to your games
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down (ooh-ooh)
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                Uh, devoted to destruction
                A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
                I'm dying slow, but the devil tryna rush me
                See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
                Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
                Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
                Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
                And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
                Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
                That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
                And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
                So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
                And I'm a sucker for pain, ain't it nothing but pain
                You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
                Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
                I'ma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train 'cause I'm a sucker for pain
                Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it (getting it)
                Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it (finish it)
                No pain (no pain), no gain (no gain)
                Never stand down, made our own way (own way)
                Never going slow, we pick up the pace (pick up the pace)
                This is what we wanted from a young age (young age)
                No emotion, that's what business is (business is)
                Lord have mercy on the witnesses
                I torture you
                Take my hand through the flames
                I torture you
                I'm just a sucker for pain
                More pain
                Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
                For more pain
                Got me begging, Begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
                For more pain
                Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
                For more pain
